The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest forms of encryption. Named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to communicate secretly with his generals, it shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' would become 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on. It wraps around the alphabet so that after 'Z', it continues from 'A'.

Though it’s not secure by today’s standards, the Caesar Cipher is a great way to understand the basics of encryption. Curious about how modern encryption methods differ from this?
